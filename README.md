# Understanding the Research Context

The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries.

The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative.

It has been observed that in the past 15 years , there has been a huge development in health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing nations in comparison to the past 30 years. Therefore, in this project we have considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis. The result indicated that most of the missing data was for population, Hepatitis B and GDP. The missing data were from less known countries like Vanuatu, Tonga, Togo, Cabo Verde etc.

# Experimental Design

Below are the steps that will be conducted in this analysis in order to fulfill the project goal satisfactorily:

Load data and preview preliminary characteristics of the dataset

Data cleaning (check for and deal with outliers, anomalies and missing data)

Perform univariate and bivariate analysis

Specify the null and alternate hypotheses

Perform hypothesis testing

Discuss the hypothesis test results

Provide project summary and conclusion

# Summary

1. The half of the population has life expentency less than 71 years.

2. Life expentency for developed countries and developing countries is different.

3. Top 5 developed countries life expentency is different.

4. Popolation depends on the year but not on the status of the country. 

5. Total expenditure in developed countries is more as compared to developing countries.

6. The proportion of Hepatitis-B immunization in developed countries and developing countries is same.

7. The alcohol level consumption rate is not dependent on country status.
